So I finally figured how I have been a book-avese person, and it would really do me good if I read a classic book or two.

And when I say that, the few books/texts in my head are:

* SICP
* Learn you a Haskell (Though it is not all *that* classic, the language is ;-))
* A collection of papers on functional programming lying in a corner of my hard-disk
* Mahabharata, unabridged

Planning to write a separate page listing out all the books, and hopefully cancelling one book per month.

EDIT: One book per month looks a bit far-fetched. Make it one book per two months.
