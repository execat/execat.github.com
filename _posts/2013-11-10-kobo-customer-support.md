![Kobo Glo]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/kobo-glo.png)

As a very happy Kobo Glo customer, I tried pushing the limits. According to [the specifications](http://www.kobo.com/koboglo/techspecs/) and [FAQ](http://www.kobo.com/koboglo/support/):

> Which languages does Kobo Glo support?
>
> Kobo Glo is a truly international eReader. At first launch, the Kobo Glo will be available in English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Japanese, Italian, and Portuguese. We're going to be launching more language support shortly, so stay tuned!

The "Language" option in my Kobo's settings shows a huge list of languages (English, Français, Française (Canada), 日本語, Deutsch, Nederlands, Italiano, Español, Português, Português (Brasil)) and unsurprisingly most of them are based on a roughly common character set except Japanese.

### But here's the thing (and I am referring to [these numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers#Ethnologue_.282013.2C_17th_edition.29) when I make my points because of the lack of a better source):

1. Out of the "More than 100 million native speakers" list of languages, only four languages are covered by the reader (Spanish, English, Portuguese, Japanese).
2. Languages like [Hindi, Marathi and Sanskrit] or [Arabic, Persian and Urdu] use the same script (Devanagari and Arabic script). Adding that to the equation, Devanagari native readers match up to the number of English native readers and Arabic script readers are twice that of Japanese (and more than Portuguese)
3. The native speakers for Mandarin, Indian languages and Arabic based languages make up more than half of the world's population (Notice at the regions that are colored yellow, orange, green on the map)

# Flaws

1. As in India, a portion we assumed to be reading and writing their native language are actually more comfortable reading English, mostly from the urban regions. In those terms, English (765M) is second only to Mandarin (1026M!), but leaving out a minority of non-native English speakers who are schooled in English, I am not sure why anyone would prefer reading English than their native language.
2. The assumption that the literature available for a language is proportional to the number of people speaking the language might not apply.
3. Assumption that the literature would be available in EPUBs. That definitely seems to be the future but I myself had a tough time looking for eBooks for Marathi and Hindi public domain books (Ramayan and Mahabharat are definitely public domain. No reason they shouldn't show up in the first 5 results of a search)
4. Assuming that a certain ratio of every language group will be a target audience could be wrong too. It could happen that Mandarin speakers don't just care about reading/are poor/have better local products (Merely as an example. Definitely doesn't apply there.) Large population != large market.
5. PDFs worked just fine for me in Marathi/Sanskrit (In fact, it was a mix of English and Sanskrit. I recommend you read [this](http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b17771201.pdf)) So the problem seems to be just the EPUBs for now.

Just discovered Kobo has officially launched in India. Hoping there will be a product customized for India.

# Support request

Here's what I wrote to the support:

> Hello,
>
> I am happy with my new Kobo Glo, though it would be a great fit for my parents too if you guys released a font for Hindi/Marathi/Sanskrit. Collectively Hindi and Marathi form a larger native audience than native English speakers and both the languages feature in the top 20 in the worldwide language usage.
>
> Literature like Mahabharat are traditionally written in these scripts and are revered by Indians (my parents included). I can guarantee that there is going to be adoption of this font if it is included as an additional download, because of the plethora of literature available in these languages.
>
> Also, request for Arabic/Persian/Urdu fonts. The points made above apply to these languages too, but I am not going to speak for them now :-)
>
> Thanks!

Awaiting reply. Reference number for follow up: #131109-001333.
