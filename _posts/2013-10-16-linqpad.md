I had the chance to read and informally review the book thanks to Packt Publishers. The book is written by SÃ©bastien Finot and can be found on [PacktPub](http://www.packtpub.com/building-interactive-queries-with-linqpad/book) store.

# What is LINQ?

[LINQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query) is a Microsoft .NET Framework component that adds native data querying capabilities to .NET languages. (From Wikipedia) That being said, LINQ runs perfectly fine on Mono on Linux. I tried for some exercises in the book and the installation of MonoDevelop was good enough to getting started with LINQ library in a C# application.

Using LINQ is just a matter of including `using System.Linq;` before a C# program (or its equivalent in any other language you are using).

# What is LINQPad?

[LINQPad](http://www.linqpad.net) lets you interactively query databases in LINQ. (From the LINQPad site) So put forward bluntly, LINQPad is a fancy wrapper around LINQ, and is probably used by the authors to decrease the learning curve.

That being said, I should mention that I was new to both C# and LINQ (I knew Java though which is a bit depressing), and reading the book wasn't difficult at all. Just [bear](http://imgur.com/NVi20k5) in mind that LINQ is just another library that makes it very easy for the programmer to look at database calls as a part of the language rather than a separate language like SQL. If you are that kind of person who loves to get into details, you might also want to get into the functional programming details on how LINQ works.

# What is in the book

1. The book isn't huge. I read the book in one day (morning and afternoon, with a little more digging in the evening), and for a person with C# experience this could very well be a read for a lazy afternoon. The book length in terms of pages is 126.
2. A very large portion of the book deals with LINQ query operators. These operators can be used to join, aggregate, select, filter data - that's almost everything one would use in a real world app using SQL. Chapter 4 and 5 covers this and was the best part of the book (around one third of the total pages)
3. Make sure you have SQL Server accessible. Chapter 5 uses it (I didn't. I had to read through those parts)

Because this book is probably aimed at beginners, you could just pass this one if you already know LINQ. LINQPad by itself is not an out-of-the-world software that you would need to take special training or join a course for. RTFMing would sail your boat just fine. 

For people like me though, who are interested in LINQ this is definitely a good starting point. It is likely you could read this book one day, and spend the next day refactoring your C# code. It is just a starting point if you want to be a LINQ guru, because that's the only amount of LINQ you can cover in 120 pages.


One issue I had while reading the book was that when reading the PDF on a small screen fit to page, the code samples become hard to read. `{`, `(` and `[` all look very similar on the monotype font. You are going to need to zoom to the page or get a bigger screen, which is a bit annyoing. Another issue with the code sample on labeled page 32 (page 43 of the PDF):

{% highlight java %}
public class Card {
    public string Suit { get; set; }
    public int Value { get; set; }
}
{% endhighlight %}

should be:

{% highlight java %}
public class Card {
    public string Suit { get; set; }
    public int FaceValue { get; set; }
}
{% endhighlight %}

That one code error I encountered. Changing it accordingly made my code run. I have submitted an errata on the site regarding this.

# Bottomline

This book might not be the right fit for people who know LINQ. This book might not also be not a right fit if all you want is getting acquainted with LINQPad.

This book is for you if you want to get started with LINQ with a minimum hassle setup (except for Microsoft SQL Server requirement for a small portion of the book). Honestly, the setup was what was holding me back from LINQ for a long time, and LINQPad did well enough to give me the final push for me to get started.
