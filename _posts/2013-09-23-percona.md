rategories: database replication
---

For those who do not know, I have been doing a *lot* of database-y stuff over the past one month and having a lot of fun doing it (was having a lot of fun until this week anyway). Among the things I tackled in no time were static backups and recovery, point-in-time recovery, automated MySQL configuration et al. I was having such a good time doing this, I went out of my way and found out some really good Perl script that examines your database environment and provides performance tuning data and recommendations called [mysqltuner](https://launchpad.net/mysqltuner).

Footnote: See how I linked to launchpad.net? I am sorry about that. I have to do my work on an Ubuntu :-(

Why would I write this article when everything was so much fun, you ask? Because this Monday I started off with replication. Now, between you and me (and that other guy reading the article right now), I couldn't stand the MySQL official documentation until this week. But *after* reading the doc I realized everything I understood from [this](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication.html) article was equivalent to everything I had understood from other articles/books
(linked below) I read, and some more.

I thought of taking the easier way, used my Google-fu to find several articles [this](http://dougbunger.blogspot.in/2011/02/mysql-replication.html), [this](http://www.hbyconsultancy.com/blog/create-a-master-master-mysql-replication-ubuntu-server-10-04-x64.html), [this](http://www.howtoforge.com/mysql_database_replication), [this](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/database-replication-mysql), [this](http://www.ovaistariq.net/565/setting-up-master-slave-replication-with-mysql/),
[this](http://www.tecmint.com/how-to-setup-mysql-master-slave-replication-in-rhel-centos-fedora/), [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-master-slave-replication-in-mysql), and almost all of them get it wrong (or didn't get it right for me anyway).

I am not going to tell you how things go wrong in these articles, because now that I *do* know what is wrong, I can just ask you to read the manpages. I have earned that right. But as pointers, there are two things wrong:

## Outdated "tutorials"

I don't know when `skip-networking` was replaced by the saner version of the same option called the `bind-address` on Debian systems. A few of those articles don't know that either. And of course, `bind-address` is just one option out of 500 of the configurable MySQL options. Go figure out the possible ways to get a MySQL configuration wrong.

Another thing(s?) I am skeptical is the `master-` set of options that supposedly go in your my.cnf. When I put those in my my.cnf my server doesn't come up running during a restart (stops fine). No error logs, nothing in the regular log. Just a screen showing 

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo service mysql restart
mysql stop/waiting
{% endhighlight %}


metaphorically screaming "fuck you" at you as you just wait to know what exactly went wrong. All `sudo service mysql status` says is `mysql stop/waiting` with a PID. Not very helpful (though mysql is not to blame here, but this is a rant. You aren't expected to find a continuity of in text).

The MySQL replication howto doesn't mention `master-` set of options either, making me think this is something that *was* a part of MySQL but isn't anymore.

## Stupid assumptions

I have spent just too much time figuring out why I couldn't connect remotely to my server. No, screw replication. Just be able to connect. Some tutorials skipped changing the `bind-address`, probably because their servers were probably already running with a more liberal `bind-address`.

Don't people try everything in a VM before putting a tutorial online? :-/

# Percona

If you do not already know what [Percona](http://www.percona.com) is, I recommend visiting their site.

Percona is ideal for database administration. For one thing, it is FOSS (thanks!), and they provide a very neat apt repository to use. Installation is neat.

A documentation page titled [How to setup a slave for replication in 6 simple steps with Percona XtraBackup](http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.1/howtos/setting_up_replication.html) gives the bare minimum of the steps required to get a replication setup working. Unlike the tutorials, the page give a nice step-by-step explanation that goes out of the way of tutorials saying "do-this, then this, then this, done!" and explains what every step does, which is a bit more important than just explaining how to do things.

Other than their documentation just being very user-friendly I think guys at Percona are building an excellent solution. Hot InnoDB backups should really be a one step solution IMHO, and Percona does it (two steps actually, but who cares).

# Moral

Never cargo cult. As [underscoreanshulk](https://twitter.com/_anshulk) says, if you are going to spend anything more than a day on something, it is probably a good idea to spend the first 3 hours trying to understand how that thing works ("RTFM" in simple programming terms).

Not being able to read documentation properly is a serious problem and it would be better if we deal with it as early as possible.
